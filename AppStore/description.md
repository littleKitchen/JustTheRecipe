## Description

**Paste any recipe URL. Get just the recipe. No life stories. No ads. No BS.**

We've all been there. You search for a simple pancake recipe and get hit with:
• 47 ads
• A 2,000-word story about someone's grandmother
• Pop-ups asking for your email
• Auto-playing videos
• And finally... maybe... the actual recipe

**Just The Recipe fixes this.**

✓ Ingredients list
✓ Step-by-step instructions

✓ Servings

That's it. No fluff. No stories. No ads. Ever.
