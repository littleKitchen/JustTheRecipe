# Pure Recipe 🍳

**Paste any recipe URL. Get just the recipe. No life stories. No ads. No BS.**

## The Problem

Every recipe website buries the actual recipe under:
- 47 ads
- A 2,000-word story about someone's grandmother
- Pop-ups asking for your email
- Auto-playing videos

## The Solution

Pure Recipe extracts ONLY what you need:
- ✅ Ingredients list
- ✅ Step-by-step instructions
- ✅ Cooking times
- ✅ Servings

That's it. No fluff.
